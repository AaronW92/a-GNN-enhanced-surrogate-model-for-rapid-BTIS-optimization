# a-GNN-enhanced-surrogate-model-for-rapid-BTIS-optimization
This is a code repository for the paper entitled  A Graph Neural Network-Enhanced Surrogate Model for Rapid Optimization of Carbon-Efficient Building Thermal Insulation Systems. 

GNNvsANNvsGPRvsXGBoost.py is the file that we used to train, validate, and test the GNN-enhanced model and compare it with other three learning models.
graphgeneration.py is the file that we used to generate graphs that used for training in GNN model.
GH_c.py is the file that we used in GHC_python component in grasshopper.
